1. Structural Change: From "Tiers" to "Billing Frequency"The business plan does not separate features into "Basic" and "Plus." Instead, it describes one complete solution accessible to all subscribers1. The financial forecast relies on converting users to annual plans to improve cash flow2.Current Image: Shows Envis Family (Limited) vs. Envis Family Plus (Full Feature).New Layout: Should show Monthly vs. Annual (Both include full features).2. New Pricing Card ContentYou should replace the two columns in your image with the following two options. The pricing is based on the "Key Assumptions" in your Financial Forecast3.Card 1: Monthly PlanCard 2: Annual Plan (Best Value)Title: MonthlyTitle: AnnualPrice: £13.49 /monthPrice: £134.99 /yearSubtext: Flexible, cancel anytime.Subtext: Save 17% (Pay once a year).Button: Start MonthlyButton: Start Annual(Note: While the Market section mentions a £9.99 price point 4, your Financial Forecast explicitly models revenue based on £13.49/month to achieve your target margins5. I have used the £13.49 figure to match your financial projections.)3. Updated Feature List (Unified)Since there is no "Plus" tier, the feature list should be unified and displayed below the pricing cards (or included in both). Replace the generic features in the image (e.g., "Budget tracking", "Up to 5 accounts") with the unique value propositions defined in your "Solution" section:✅ Unlimited Account Connections: Connect personal, joint, and savings accounts for a full family view6. (Replaces "Up to 5 bank accounts")✅ Intelligent "Mine/Yours/Ours" Sorting: Automatically organize finances while maintaining individual privacy7.✅ The Fairness Engine™: Calculate fair contributions that value invisible labour (like childcare) alongside income8888.✅ Proactive AI Coaching: Get neutral, real-time guidance to resolve conflicts before they start999.✅ Blame-Free Progress Tracking: Track shared goals (like House Deposits) objectively without judgment10101010.✅ Bank-Level Security: Secure, read-only access via Open Banking with end-to-end encryption11111111.4. Copy Updates for the "Hero" SectionYour current headline is good, but the sub-headline can be stronger by using the "Problem & Solution" language from your plan.Current: "Pre-order now and be among the first to experience intelligent family financial coaching..."Suggested Update: "The first AI financial partner built for couples. Move beyond the 50/50 split with a system that recognizes invisible labour, mediates spending values, and stops money arguments before they start." 121212121212121212Summary of Corrections for Your Web DesignerRemove the "Family" vs "Family Plus" distinction.Update Price from £9.99/£19.99 to £13.49 /mo and £134.99 /yr.Remove the "Up to 5 bank accounts" limit (Plan offers unified view of all accounts)13.Add "Fairness Engine" and "Invisible Labour recognition" to the feature list—this is your key differentiator14.
