I need you to update the envis.money landing page to reflect our finalized business plan. We are building a "relationship-first" fintech product.

1. Project Context & Brand Identity

Product Name: Envis

Tagline: "Your Family's Financial Partner, Finally."

Core Value Prop: The first AI-powered personal finance platform built specifically for couples, designed to eliminate financial conflict and invisible labor.

Brand Archetype: "The Sage & The Caregiver." The tone should be warm, intelligent, judgment-free, and empowering.

Visual Style: Clean, modern, and approachable. Use calming colors (blues and greens) to signal trust and stability. Avoid cold, corporate finance aesthetics.

2. Page Structure & Copy Requirements Please refactor the landing page to include the following sections in this order:

A. Hero Section

Headline: "Your Family's Financial Partner, Finally."

Sub-headline: "The first AI-powered platform that manages the emotional and practical complexities of couple finance. Stop arguing about money and start building your future."

CTA Button: "Join the Waiting List" (Primary), "See How It Works" (Secondary).

B. The "Problem" Section (The Crisis)

Header: "Why managing money together feels so hard."

Data points to display:

"72% of couples experience shame or discomfort discussing money."

"52% report financial stress damages their relationship."

"Couples manage 7-10 different financial products without a full-picture view."

Key Insight: Existing apps treat family finance as "individual finance times two." We treat you as a partnership.

C. The "Solution" Section (Our Proprietary Modules) Create feature blocks/cards for our 5 core modules:

Intelligent Accounting: "Mine, Yours, Ours." Automatically structures money to ensure transparency while respecting individual autonomy.

The Fairness Engine: "Value Invisible Labor." A proprietary algorithm that recognizes non-monetary contributions (like childcare and housework) to calculate a truly fair contribution split.

Blame-Free Progress Tracking: "Focus on Progress, Not Guilt." Real-time, objective goal monitoring that removes the 'blame game' from missed targets.

Values Mediation: "Honor Your Differences." Psychological modeling that helps Savers and Spenders find a middle ground without conflict.

Proactive AI Coaching: "Stop Fights Before They Start." An AI that detects conflict triggers and intervenes with neutral, de-escalating guidance.

D. Social Proof / Validation

Header: "Backed by Science & Research."

Content: Mention that the system is grounded in peer-reviewed behavioural science and validated by primary research with 100+ UK families.

E. Footer

Includes links to "Privacy," "Security" (Mention Bank-Level Encryption), and contact info: vshenbagaraja@gmail.com.

3. Technical Instructions

Use a mobile-first responsive design (Tailwind CSS preferred).

Ensure the "Join Waiting List" CTA is prominent and sticks as the user scrolls.

Use high-quality, abstract illustrations or icons for the 5 modules (avoid generic stock photos of people shaking hands).
